### üíª About

USM ACM-IEEE is the combination of two separate organizations, under one roof. We acted as two separate entities for years before realizing that our goals were the exact same, to benefit student and build outstanding contacts around them. So in 2019 we decided to combine our efforts for the betterment of the Students! We host tutorials every week. Topics range in variety but they are topics not currently taught in class. Topics covered in the past have been: General Web Development, Javascript, ICPC Prep, Pentesting, and Unity Game Development.
